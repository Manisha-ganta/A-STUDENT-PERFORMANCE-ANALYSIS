<h3> INTRODUCTION <h3></h3>

<h5> Overview </h5>

<p> The kids of today are our society's future, and their potential is a priceless asset that must be developed and made available. Understanding the elements that go into realising their potential and fostering an environment that supports their achievement is crucial. </p>

<p> The project in the field of data analytics that aims to leverage data analytics techniques to gain insights into student performance and unleash the full potential of young learners. 
By analysing comprehensive data sets and applying various data analysis techniques, the project seeks to understand the factors influencing student success, develop targeted interventions, and inform evidence-based policies to enhance educational outcomes. </p>

<h5> Purpose </h5>
<p> To fully understand the aspects that contribute to our youth's success and growth, completing a student performance analysis is necessary in the context of maximising their potential. The analysis tries to achieve the following goals by looking at several facets of student performance : </p>
<ol>
   <li> Identify Factors Influencing STUDENT PERFORMANCE </li>
   <li> Addressing Barriers </li>
   <li> Improve Academic Interventions </li>
   <li> Enhance Resource Allocation </li>
   <li> Foster a Data-Driven Education System </li>
</ol>

<h5> Proposed solution </h5>

<p> The proposed solution aims to leverage data analytics to analyse student performance and unleash the potential of our youth. By utilising comprehensive data sets, including academic records, extracurricular activities, and socio-economic backgrounds, we can gain valuable insights into the factors influencing student success. </p>

<h5> Data Visualisations </h5>
<ol>
   <li> Finding whether females perform better or males? </li>
   <li> Finding how the parental level of education affects the performance of the student ? </li>
   <li> Find the performance of students with the ethnicity/race? </li>
   <li> Find the performance of students based on whether the lunch is free or standard ? </li>
   <li> Find the performance on the basis of test preparation ? </li>
   <li> Find the number of students in each ethnicity ? </li>
   <li> Finding the performance of students in each subject with respect to their ethnicity? </li>
   <li> Find which group of students performing best on the basis of parental level of education and ethnicity ? </li>
   <li> Finding which gender is performing better under the influence of the ethnicity ? </li>
   <li> Finding how ethnicity is affected by test preparation ? </li>
</ol>

<h5> Dashboard </h5>
<p> Dashboard 1: Performance of the students on different Parameter </p>
<p> Dashboard 2: How ethnicity/Race is related to the other parameters ? </p>

<h5> Milestone 5: Story </h5>
<p> The story provides the variation in student’s performance based on different parameters. The story has a total of 9 visualisations and each visualisation has an interconnected meaning and all the visualisations are pointing toward the performance of students. From the whole story, it can be inferred that the females from group E with standard lunch whose parental level of education is Master’s degree and completed the test preparation have shown the most promising results. </p>


<h3> RESULT </h3>
<p> The results are promising and astonishing as, it can be seen that:- </p>
<ul>
   <li> On the basis of gender, females are performing better than males; </li>
   <li> On the basis of parental level of education, student’s whose parents having master’s degree are showing the best performance; </li>
   <li> On the basis of ethnicity and race, group E had the most promising results; </li>
   <li> On the basis of test preparation, student who had been prepared for the test are showing the better results; </li>
   <li> On the basis of lunch, students who are having standard lunch are showing better results;</li>
   <li> On the basis of the scores in three subjects, the average reading score is best, then comes the average writing score and in the last comes is the average maths score. </li>
</ul>

<p> Dashboard 1 provides the information about the students’ performance with respect to each domain, and it shows the same results as inferred above. </p>

<p> Dashboard 2 provides information about how ethnicity is related with each other dimensions. It shows the largest number of students are from Group C. Students from Group A are performing the worst in all scenarios and students from Group E are performing the best. Females are performing best in each group. Students who have completed the test preparation are performing the best from each group. Students from group E whose parental level degree is Master’s degree are the best performers. </p>

<p> Story provides information about the student’s performance. From the whole story, it can be inferred that the females from group E with standard lunch whose parental level of education is Master’s degree and completed the test preparation have shown the most promising results. </p>
